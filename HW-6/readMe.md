# HW-6 Report

##My Take
  The fact that we can now have if and then statements, with changing variables by the click of a button is pretty awesome. I wasn't in class on Wednesday but through viewing the work of my classmates it seems that its opening up a new world of artistic ability for us.

  ##Issues
  Since I wasn't in class my Var = state is screwing with my stoplight starting and stopping. Hopefully in class we can go over how to get my button to work. Since the stop light is supposed to be red with the "Do not walk hand". The Red button is supposed to be clickable that changes the light to green and giving the walking man, indicating its safe to cross the road.
