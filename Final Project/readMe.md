# Final Project

After having scrapped multiple things multiple times, I finally found enough sources to help me try and complete this old school style snake game. Lacking a creative mind, I thought at least this was something I would have been able to play. However, the code didn't exactly work. I was able to create a setting in which the food would disappear after each pass, but then I hit a wall with trying to figure out how to add a tail upon eating each block. Once the tail eventually comes in contact with the head, the game starts over fresh again. Well I wasn't able to get to that point so unfortunately my code doesn't run. I didn't see a point in making a video for something that didn't run. Also, once completing the disappearing food, the snake will only go to the far right and bottom hand screen of the window, essentially helping me chalk this assignment as a dud.


This class challenged the absolute heck out of me, and really opened my eyes to a side of technological creativity through something I previously thought was only applicable for specified uses. The amount of time it takes to fully learn a language is actually amplified here in my opinion because of the different creative minds. Java isn't completely discovered yet in the sense that there are potentially no limits. The harder you push the further you go, meaning for the 300 level courses I'm going to have to push a hell of a lot harder.

Thanks again to everyone and Mr. Musick, see you all next semester.
