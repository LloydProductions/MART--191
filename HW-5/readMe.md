# HW-5 Repot

## Week Overview

I wouldn't have completed this assignment had we been required to turn it in on Monday. The complexity of the different mathematical variables is headache worthy. Not only did I have a problem turning this in but I pretty much hated what it became.

I started with the idea of having a figure shooting this array of triangles from his hands, in which out of his palm there would be a digitally rendered piece of art. After messing around with these variables for hours I pretty much said screw it.

## Opinion

I need to practice this more, but the pieces I have done and liked, I felt like I really didn't have enough time to finish or even scrape the top of what I was attempting. This scares me  for the 340 classes because we are just now learning the basic functions of coding and its requirements. In the upper levels more will be required and along with the idea of it being asthetically pleasing.

# Outlook

The food and the rum is gone, moral is low... but I still have hope...
