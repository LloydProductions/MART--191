# HW-2 Report

## Class Overview
This week, I got _incredibly_ lost, like no lie. Actual coding hasn't even began and we've already held the class up for questions regarding how to turn this very assignment in.  I am taking 4 online classes this semester with this class, which has left me time to contemplate what the major issues I might have later on ( these issues are listed below ).
### Issues
**1. Processes**
  * Learning the beginning to end processes of writing a code and then through some sort of application making it _"come alive"_
  * The _Process_ that each app or program requires to run. (I am currently still figuring out our GitHub page after week 2)

**2. Short Cuts (Markdown, Powershell, Ect.)**
  * Any and all of these short cuts will take a long, long time to learn. Not just learning them, but comprehending which application uses a certain shortcut key.  
  * Just the daily, continued use of the Markdown language will solve this. However, like all languages if you don't put in the time and effort, you won't see results.

**3. Complexity**
  * The complexity of the work we will be completing later on is a grey area in my understanding of this course. Especially since we were told that "we will spend hours searching for one comma, or that is disrupting the rest of our written code"
    * Side note - I am not looking forward to this aspect at all.
  * This is my first time using any type of program or text editor, so just the simple commands in PowerShell have seemed as foreign as   

May _like_ the professor.
