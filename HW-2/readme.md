# HW-2 Report

## Week Overview
This week, I got _incredibly_ lost, like no lie. Actual coding hasn't even began and we've already held the class up for questions regarding how to turn this very assignment in. This scares me a fair amount...
With just sitting here today after class I contemplated what major issues I might have later on ( these issues are listed below ).
### Issues
**1. Processes**
  * Learning the beginning to end processes of writing a code and then through some sort of application making it _"come alive"_
  * The _Process_ that each app or program requires to run. (I am currently still figuring out our GitHub page after week 2)

**2. Short Cuts (Markdown, Powershell, Ect.)**
  * Any and all of these short cuts will take a long, long time to learn. Not just learning them, but comprehending which application uses a certain shortcut key.  
  * Just the daily, continued use of the Markdown language will solve this. However, like all languages if you don't put in the time and effort, you won't see results.

**3. Complexity**
  * The complexity of the work we will be completing later on is a grey area in my understanding of this course. Especially since we were told that "we will spend hours searching for one comma, or that is disrupting the rest of our written code"
  * Side note - I am not looking forward to this aspect at all.
  * This is my first time using any type of program or text editor, so just the simple commands in PowerShell have seemed as foreign as   

The largest issue I've had with code so far would be trying to figure out how to include a web page. The bracketing system is hard to understand, since I'm not used to this type of language. Its hard to differentiate the implied meaning of a keyed sequence after another rather than just on its own. (Example to follow)

```[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)```

As I explained above the [I'm an inline-style link] is difficult to understand, just on its own. I probably sound incredibly elementary to most of you who will read this but after all, this is a whole new world to me. Once I figured out the meaning/application of the "add a link" it came in handy.

I have found the external link to the 340 web page incredibly helpful so far in this class, that will be posted bellow
