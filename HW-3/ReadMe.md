HW-3 Self Portrait

This week I focused on p5.js and made this amazing self portrait of my self. I thoughts the process was interesting, especially figuring out fills and the translate function.


The issues I had with translate occurred when I literally lost my nose and mouth, after a translate was unknowingly deleted.


I wish we could have a graph on the web page as we place figures though, it would make life so much easier to see actual numerical values instead of guessing and checking.

I just referenced the p5.js site, a little too much. I also referenced the code that was uploaded to the repo. So far the difficulty of learning and processes have been pretty sucky. But I've realized if I spend about an hour just trying out new code and messing around I start cruising and my fingers don't really need my brain to work behind them.

Bellow here is my homework URL:
