# Homework 9

Only turning this in the day before our final project, so that should go to show how well this class has gone for me this semester.
Honestly this class has been one of the hardest for me to keep up with so far through college. Mostly because the new information
learned was so detail intensive and really required a lot of independent visualization and usage. Overall it was a good class,
going forward I'm without a doubt going to need to do some research and invest more time.
