Skateboarder....


So I got lost completely in the sauce...
The hardest part of this was once I was able to figure out "mouseX and mouseY".
Once I actually created my skateboarder, I went to the moving figures of the yellow lines for the road. However once I created more than the two lines seen, my boarder completely disapeared and I wasn't able to figure out why. With that being said this road was painted like complete shiat. How ever I am enjoying putting numerical values into Atom and finding animations and other things of the sorts from the index tab afterwards.
